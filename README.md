Pawmate, an informative desktop website about dogs and different breeds with educational linked articles, a page for each breed and an interactive quiz.

## Purpose
Created as an initial project for my ISTE140 course, focused on UI/UX design principles and getting a comfortable handle on working on a front-end project. The website itself functions as a way to allow users to pick a breed that best suites their lifestyles.

## Team
This project was created by 4 team members: Grishma Bhandari, Reema Maryam Naheem, Madheeha Sameen as well as myelf.

## Features
# Dog Breed Pages
The website focused on 4 breeds, each with a page that includes a general description of the dog as well as certain facts and statistics on the right.
# Summary Table
A summary page was included with a table that compares the 4 breeds in terms of lifestyle requirements, size and other such factors.
# PerfectPaw Quiz
The summary page includes a link to a quiz that allows the user to give certain information about their own daily lifestyle and recieve the name of a breed that best suites their needs and what they can provide.
# Educational Articles
