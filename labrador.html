                <h2>About the labrador</h2>
                <p>Labradors are regularly referred to as one of the best dog breeds for families, known for a fondness for being around children and getting along well with other pets in the home too. The labrador is a playful, kind and affectionate dog who loves nothing more than to spend time with their pack</p>
                <p>They're full of energy and incredibly smart, so they're well suited to those with active lifestyles.They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.</p>
                <p>The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott.</p>
